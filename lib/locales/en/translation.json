  "faq": {
    "heading": "Frequently asked questions",
    "q1": "Do Foytech's solutions follow the Swedish Bar Association's guidelines?",
    "a11": "In the free version of Rumpole, different AI engines are used from time to time. This means that external AI engines may be used, which means that sensitive data (such as confidential information) should not be entered in prompts, but only pure legal data queries, such as requesting the drafting of a memo/legal research on a certain issue. However, Foytech cannot be held responsible if Rumpole is used in violation of these guidelines.",
    "a12": "Foytech's professional platform has features to use a local AI engine when processing classified data, enabling the handling of such data with AI technology. Please contact Foytech for further details on how its professional platform has been designed for adherance to strict customer guidelines on AI usage.",
    "q2": "What type of data is used in Rumpole?",
    "a2": "Rumpole is entirely based on public legal data. In Foytech's professional platform, it is possible to add your own data sets that complement the public legal data.",
    "q3": "What's the difference between the free and professional versions of Rumpole?",
    "a31": "Rumpole is a basic solution that uses smaller AI engines than the professional solution. Rumpole is based on public legal data only, while the professional solution can be tailored to the customer's own data. The professional version also has functionality for work products other than legal research, with support for drafting court submissions, for example.",
    "a32": "The professional platform also enables the use of classified data by the option of using external AI engines for such data handling. The professional solution is also customizable graphically, i.e. can be customized according to the customer's wishes on platform name and graphic profile. However, the free version uses the same proprietary algorithms for data management as the professional version.",
    "q4": "Does Foyen Law Firm have any insight into data at Foytech?",
    "a41": "No, Foyen Law Firm is a client of Foytech but has no ownership in Foytech and Foytech handles all customer data with strict confidentiality. No customer has access to any other customer's data. The professional version is generally set up on customer-specific servers, unless otherwise agreed.",
    "a42": "The architecture of Foytech's platform is continuously refined based on feedback from all customers. Before Foytech was spun off into a separate company, the architecture refinement was solely based on feedback from the various legal area specialists in Foyen."
